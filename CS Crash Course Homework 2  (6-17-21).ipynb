    "# New Concepts + Homework Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "Phew! We're all done with review. Now, I'm going to explain some new concepts to build off of your existing knowledge base.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Concept: Getting the length of the list\n",
    "This one's easy. If I ever need to get the length of a list, I write:\n",
    "``` python\n",
    "my_list = [3, 2, 1, 0]\n",
    "\n",
    "len(my_list)\n",
    ">>> 4\n",
    "```\n",
    "This is useful when we want to compare list lengths, or when we want to iterate through the range of the length of the list, and not just iterate through its elements.\n",
    "\n",
    "``` python\n",
    "# FYI: These two processes do the same thing\n",
    "\n",
    "for i in range(len(my_list)):\n",
    "    element = my_list[i]\n",
    "    print(element)\n",
    "    \n",
    ">>> 3\n",
    ">>> 2\n",
    ">>> 1\n",
    ">>> 0\n",
    "\n",
    "for x in my_list:\n",
    "    print(x)\n",
    "    \n",
    ">>> 3\n",
    ">>> 2\n",
    ">>> 1\n",
    ">>> 0\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Concept: Indexing into lists\n",
    "As review, a list is a grouping of any form of data (ints, strings, floats, etc.).\n",
    "\n",
    "Examples:\n",
    "``` python\n",
    "fruits = [\"banana\", \"apple\", \"guava\", \"peach\", \"durian\", \"mango\"]\n",
    "famous_jersey_numbers = [23, 24, 6, 8, 99, 42]\n",
    "interesting_floats = [3.14, 2.71, 9.81]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "We've established that you can loop through lists, and that counting them off starts from 0, but we don't know how to get elements from the list yet.\n",
    "\n",
    "***\n",
    "Before we dive in deeper, I want to differentiate between an **element** and an **index**. I'll be using both very purposefully, so it's important that you know the difference. I'll be using the `fruits` list to illustrate.\n",
    "\n",
    "The ith **element** of a list employs regular counting (1, 2, 3, 4, 5). The 1st element of `fruits` is `\"banana\"`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The ith **index** of a list employs indexing (0, 1, 2, 3, 4). The 1st index of `fruits` is `\"apple\"`. The 0th index of `fruits` is `\"banana\"`\n",
    "***\n",
    "\n",
    "If I want the 0th index (1st element) of `fruits`, I will write: `fruits[0]`\n",
    "If I want the 3rd index (4th element) of `fruits`, I will write: `fruits[3]`\n",
    "\n",
    "Example code:\n",
    "``` python\n",
    "zeroth_fruit = fruits[0]\n",
    "print(zeroth_fruit)\n",
    ">>> \"banana\"\n",
    "\n",
    "first_fruit = fruits[1]\n",
    "print(first_fruit)\n",
    ">>> \"apple\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "***\n",
    "\n",
    "## Homework Problem\n",
    "There's only one problem, but it's reasonably hard. Work through it carefully, and refer back to the examples and notes when needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Introduction\n",
    "The Clippers just beat the Jazz 119 to 111 without Kawhi Leonard. To investigate this, you want to see how the players from each team stack up against each other. \n",
    "\n",
    "The metric that you're going to be using today is a dumbed-down version of the actual NBA standard efficiency metric. \n",
    "\n",
    "The NBA's formula for efficiency is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\frac{(PTS + REB + AST + STL + BLK − \\text{Missed } FG − \\text{Missed } FT - TO)}{\\text{Minutes Played}} \n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "\\\n",
    "For the sake of brevity, we will use the following formula for efficiency:\n",

    "$$\n",
    "\\frac{(PTS + REB - \\text{Missed } FG)}{\\text{Minutes Played}}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
