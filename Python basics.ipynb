    "1. Ints: Integers are whole numbers (positive or negative)\n",
    "2. Floats: Floats are numbers expressed as decimals.\n",
    "2. Strings: Strings are a CS way to say text. Strings in Python are surrounded by single quotation marks (`'`), or double quotation marks (`\"`). Whether you use single or double doesn't matter (most use double), but make sure to be consistent.\n",

    "2. To **check if something is true**, use double `==`.\n",
    "3. In CS, a boolean value is either true or false. \n",

    "    - In Python, false is denoted as `False`\n",

    "    i_dont_like_food = ~i_like_food\n",

    "        i_should_become_a_chef = True\n",

    "1. Every Programming language has ranges. In essence, they tell the computer to traverse from the beginning of the range to the end of the range.\n",
    "    - Python ranges are extremely easy to remember. It's just range(`<start>`, `<finish>`) OR range(`<finish>`)\n",
    "    - There is one caveat: The upper bound (finish) is *non-inclusive*, meaning the computer leaves it out of the range. Example below.\n",
