    "    - Loop through restaurants_dict.\n",
    "    - Inside the loop, assign a new variable `restaurant_name` (note, this is a singular restaurant name as opposed to your growing list of restaurant_names) to `key`, since the keys of the restaurants_dict are just names of the restaurants\n",
    "    - You want to get the restaurant properties from this restaurants dictionary, so you can check if price range and stars match your inputs.\n",
    "        - Assign a variable named `restaurant_properties` to the value of the restaurant dictionary queried at `key`. \n",
    "        - Recall that you can get values from dictionaries with the following syntax: `dictionary_name[key]`\n",
    "    - Now it's time to get price range and number of stars from the restaurant. \n",
    "        - Assign a variable named `price_range` to the fifth index of `restaurant_properties`. \n",
    "        - Assign a variable named `restaurant_number_of_stars` to the first index of `restaurant_properties`.\n",
    "    - It's time to finally check if:\n",
    "        - The restaurant's number of stars matches the function's inputted number of stars\n",
    "        - Our price limit is greater than or equal to the lower-bound of the price range\n",
    "            - Why? Say a restaurant is ranged 115-400 dollars, and our user inputs 300 for their price limit. You only care that 300 is greater than 115\n",
    "    - After checking these things, if there's a match, we want to `.append` the restaurant name to our list of `restaurant_names`\n",
